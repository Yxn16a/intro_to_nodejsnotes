// how did node was born:
// 1995 was born, 1996 netscape created livewire  and this was the beginning of 
// of the server side java scrip 
// 2008 chrome was created and v8 engine was created
// this made javascript to run faster and v8 
// node js was created in 2009
// node js run javascript outside the browser by Ryan dhal(the creater of node js)
// it was built on v8 engine 
// node is javascrip runtime not a frame work
// runtime: is environment where javascript run
// libuv:is a c library that work out with io
// Ryan combined libuv and v8 engine
// window object gives us the tools that we can 
// chrome comes the java script engine
// running javascript without engine
// what happens by running node in the terminal: 
// - REPL(READEVALPRINT AND LOOP) this happens when we run node in the terminal with no argu
// ment for example we can run javascript code
// REPL: our node will read, write, pring and loop
// read:breaking the code into peaces and perse them(or evaluate them by v8 and the result
// will be printed on the screen) 
// REPL IS GOOD for testing not for saving the code for a long period of time
// we can run code using terminal node run
